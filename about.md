i have been in different communities and countries, through working in different participatory \ hands-on \ make-it-work events. i am through the continuous development and change from what i'm learning: if you make something yourself; simple or complex, you can understand and approve that things can be distorted in custom and common manners. Sharing, caring about environment, believing that interconnection and diversity are inherently good- and this is ironically very difficult to counter; unless you are making/hacking. Because making/hacking comes before the context and turns into an act of inquiry and curiosity, at once analytical and exploratory.  

To facilitate a new (old) narrative structures of social inter-action, i’m in practice in self sufficient + circular dynamics through biology, arts and technology. Hardly defining a profession to myself after my experiences, i might say i'm a constant amateur, learner, mediater, a social designer (may be a social activist?) or little Miss Lillian Greneker ..

### Mi! in PopMachina

i’m passionate on focusing on nature, people and the stories they carry, food and food culture, biotechnology and art+science within an interdisciplinary collaborations.

Through the Pop Academy experience i am seeing myself learning many random skills and specifically focus on art and biology department by collaborating with each other (global) and our closer environment (local).

i am calling my documentation site as Mi!Machina, **Mi** in here is in latin means _My beloved!_ or _My dear!_  
and this potato avatar is referring a lot about what i have been doing related to this specific topic.

i've found myself in this setting so sudden however, i can't wait turning on that machine and seeing it cycles, mutates and serves.
