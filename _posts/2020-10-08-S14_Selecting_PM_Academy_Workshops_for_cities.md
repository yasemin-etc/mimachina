# NULL- a SelfReplicating Kitchen  
  
As time goes by, the opening up a CircularMakerSpace is getting more clear in detail after many inspirational talks and discussions, including the personal positions in the coming structure. I have been consistent on what i have been doing/learning so far and interested in applying in İstanbul from the time I arrived. The hope never goes far, and the topic is becoming more solid then just a cloud.  
While thinking of clarifying my self project on PopMachina, there was a CallforProposal from Nuffic NESO as GreenCitiesOrangeWays. Therefore i prepared a sheet to describe the 
 
![NULL]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-10-08-S14_Selecting_PM_Academy_Workshops_for_cities/NULL.jpg)  
  
I am selected to share this idea more in detail in coming week to some expertises on feasibility, creative elements and possible problem & solving.  
  
The Kitchen is a social and pleasent space where the social differences and circulation of ideas, and hospitality is embraced. We as human are consuming for food for sure, and we produce a weighty waste in many ways from the production till the consumption. Kitchen itself is a perfect space to gather the variety and share the spirit of reflecting the specific ecological, economical and geopolitical contexts of today and in years to come.   

Therefore in this Kitchen mise an scene, calling Null, is used not only to produce and consume but also to deal with how to manage the food-product waste and turn it useful for kitchen production for the sake of circularity. It has a mobius strip to produce its own edibles and appliances from its own waste.  
  
Two types of grow & make, and compost;  
 * food, and compost the waste of it.
 * grow appliances and  compost the waste of it.
