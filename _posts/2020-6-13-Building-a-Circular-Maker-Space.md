# a Logo for your Circular Maker Space  
  
Let's first look at the features of logo.  
 * should bring an immediate and open impression on the philosophy and/or identity.  
 * should be in an appropriate style choice as lettermarks, wordmarks, brandmarks, combination marks and emblems.  
 * should be in a color stragetically, by understanding color psychology.
    
Typical intention to describe Makers' space is usually an image of a *hand* or characteristics of the location that is used for it, is as well used for naming the place, which i like the most. For the Circular Economy *circulating arrow* in order to describe the loop of the idea of reduce, reuse, recycle together with some icons to show up the process and mostly within the colors blue and/or green.

For the moment for this project, the city of istanbul has an option to use a part in Edirnekapı İstaç (Environmental Management Department of the city) which does not give any inspiration in graphical identity from its architecture, yet there is no name picked up for this coming makers' space. 

If i want to keep the image of cycle related to istanbul, i might end up with a lot of cliché visual with many towers and domes that are used for many other reasons, which i definitely don't want.  
Consequently i thought of how to symbolise this cycle by using another subject other than arrow, and i ended up using human image - *the makers* themselves cycling, like a humanwheel.

It is acceptable that all these things we are talking is human thing but also for in istanbul before everything, there is another human you are in contact since it is very crowded. There are many times you don't see the the sky, the soil, the sea, the moon, the stars, the emptiness, but you definitely hear and toss many human.  
  
  
Meanwhile thinking of how to bring more action instead having a withdrawn turn: they might better bend backwards so they are as well open to outside, and there might be more then two people. Here is the half cycle sketch i made in __Inkscape__.

in order to realise this more clean in graphics,i decided to rig a human body, multiply with 5 to symbolise each letter of STEAM and i made that (rigging) in __Blender__ which is the _free and open source_ 3D creation suite.
