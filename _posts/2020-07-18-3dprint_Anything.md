# About About Design with Additive Manufacturing
Anastasia Pistofidoul is cofounder of Fablab Barcelona, where they work about textile and material in FabTextiles Lab, and they work in implications and applications of digital fabrication applied in the fashion industry, biology. In the Lab, they make research Digital fabrication, wearable technologies, biomaterials and parametric design. 

What is so impressive and attractive is the way she appreciates the reality, as she mentions that _it's all about the matter of choices._ Instead of making propaganda of her own choices and worsening the rechargeable part, she applies a tossing practice, revealing a strong statement.

# About Molding and Casting  

Eduardo Chamorro, is one of the inspirer of IAAC's FabLab, he knows many things about different techniques of fabrication. He studied architecture, grad and master in Madrid. Later on he was giving some design courses and introduction of machines in the universitiy's fablab. Randomly got an offer from a fablan in South Korea, there he had a good access to new technologies in fabrication. 

He is enthousiastic of opening one's eye for 3d printing.  
  
Eventually in 3d printing there are two types inputs that i am interested in, one is filaments from recycling plastic  and the other is biomaterials, which is either coming from food loss/waste and/or paste from biodegradeble ingredients. (I should add here none of those should support creating a larger waste)   
Here i would like to give one example from a Rotterdam based architect's, Panos Sakkas and Foteini Setaki work, [The New Raw](https://thenewraw.org) (such a beautiful name by the way). They are using robotic 3d printing with recycled plastic to develop circular design concepts to stimulate awareness and local production.
