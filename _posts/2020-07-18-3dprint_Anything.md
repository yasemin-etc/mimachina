# About About Design with Additive Manufacturing
  
Eduardo Chamorro, is one of the inspirer of IAAC's FabLab, he knows many things about different techniques of fabrication. He studied architecture, grad and master in Madrid. Later on he was giving some design courses and introduction of machines in the universitiy's fablab. Randomly got an offer from a fablan in South Korea, there he had a good access to new technologies in fabrication. 

He is enthousiastic of opening one's eye for 3d printing.  Hacking it or just setting manual code and decode it. 
There are seven categories in additive manufacturing but Eduardo mentions three of them: 
  
 * Extrusion (FuseDepositionModelling-FDM) It is a filament-based process in which filament is melted and forms the paste that is harden again later.  
 * Light Polymerized (Stereolithography-SLA) This technique uses ultraviolet light (or a laser) and applied to a thin liquid film and polymerize it in a spatially selective manner.
 * Powder Bed (3DP) There is an inkjet print head moves across a bed of powder material, depositing a liquid binding material; so these two materials come together to selectively harden.  
 Basically we need to understand the attitude of the machine to print the shape with a specific structure within. To get the main shape, there is usually multiple boxes of movement as *rectangular, triangular or diagrid, wiggle or honeycomb.*

Solid waste management affects everyone, and it seems that is important to focus on 3D Printing and the additive manufacturing industry as a whole. This is the future of manufacturing in a sense. Companies can carefully consider material choice in the design stage; choosing the plastic with the lowest impact that still offers the needed performance, and have a plan for its end of life.   
  
Eventually in 3d printing there are two types inputs that i am interested in, one is filaments from recycling plastic  and the other is biomaterials, which is either coming from food loss/waste and/or paste from biodegradeble ingredients. (I should add here none of those should still trigger creating a larger waste)   

Filaments from recycling plastic:  
Here i would like to give one example from a Rotterdam based architect's, Panos Sakkas and Foteini Setaki work, [The New Raw](https://thenewraw.org) (such a beautiful name by the way). They are using robotic 3d printing with recycled plastic to develop circular design concepts to stimulate awareness and local production.  
  
Bioprinting:  
Before the oil based plastics, there was the bioplastic. So this is not an invention.
