# About Design with Additive Manufacturing  
Eduardo Chamorro, is one of the inspirer of IAAC's FabLab, he knows many things about different techniques of fabrication. He studied architecture, grad and master in Madrid. Later on he was giving some design courses and introduction of machines in the universitiy's fablab. Randomly got an offer from a fablan in South Korea, there he had a good access to new technologies in fabrication. 

He is enthousiastic of opening one's eye for 3d printing.  
  
Eventually in 3d printing there are two types inputs that i am interested in, one is filaments from recycling plastic  and the other is biomaterials, which is either coming from food loss/waste and/or paste from biodegradeble ingredients. (I should add here none of those should support creating a larger waste)   
Here i would like to give one example from a Rotterdam based architect's work, The New Raw(link here) - such a beautiful name by the way. They are using quite big machinery to 3d print recycled plastic and make up some city furniture.
