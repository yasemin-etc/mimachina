*Inspirational Talk by Anastasia Pistofidoul-BIOCRAFT* â™¡  
*Molding and Casting*  

# About BIOCRAFT
Anastasia Pistofidoul is cofounder of Fablab Barcelona, where they work about textile and material in FabTextiles Lab, and they work in implications and applications of digital fabrication applied in the fashion industry, biology. In the Lab, they make research Digital fabrication, wearable technologies, biomaterials and parametric design. 

What is so impressive and attractive is the way she appreciates the reality, as she mentions that _it's all about the matter of choices._ Instead of making propaganda of her own choices and worsening the rechargeable part, she applies a tossing practice, revealing a strong statement.

# About Molding and Casting  

We have been askd to gather some materials for in case to participate molding and casting workshop in our kitchens.   

 * gelatin
 * agar agar
 * honey  
 * milk  
 * chocolate bar  
   
 * objects you want to cast
 * 3d print your mold or any recipient you want to use as a mold
 * container for use in microwave or a pot to heat food 
 * a spoon
 * a scale for weighing food
 * access to a refrigerator and/or freezer  
   
 Personally, i am not so funded to use animal products in my personla life so i decided to find substitute of animal based products from the list. 
 
 * instead of gelati, agar agar is one option which is already on the list. Another option is kosher gelatine, arrowroot (according to my earlier experiences, arrowroot with dairy is not becoming jelly, but is it like that with non dairy milk?, don't know and won't take the risk for now) and xantham gum (that i picked).
 * instead of milk, as Xavi suggested in our talk, i have coconut milk.
 * Honey in the list is for consistency, and i used homemade nonbee honey.  
 
 Fairly speaking, vegan doesn't always mean perfectly sustainable. However, as Anastasia says, that is a matter of choice and the balance in me works better now with these replacements)

this makes me ask about the lifecycle of a biomold and how to stabilize them.   
  
    
    
 __The Unuseless Potato Project__  
 Some years back, i had a chance to experiment in bio fablab for biohack academy at Waag Society. 
 I had my assignment about a self sufficient potato and it's side products (mostly starch) as alternatives of bio materials.
