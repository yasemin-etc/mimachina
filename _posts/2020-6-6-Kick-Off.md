*Kick-off*
*building a personal website*  
  
  
Welcome to championsworld, where many kind of makers are picked from 8 pilot cities and collected in front of a digital blackboard, for an academy about practicing, learning and generating collaboartive makers' space for the circular economy in real. We don't have full access on experimenting in the lab and digital fabrication;since we are in this period of pandemy, but each thursday lectures presented by professionals in many topics related to makers' world and circular economy.  

There in the academy, they provoke our imagination and what we can do for the sake of ourselves, our peripher and/or for all planet. Therefore we have some assignments to practice many things as much as possible.   

Well as a [first assignment](https://hackmd.io/@fablabbcn/SyLUuOS38#Weekly-Assignment---Building-a-Personal-Website), we are asked to build our site in Github, in order to document our experience in the academy. i have met Github years ago and i coincidentally built a site then, but did leave it there in the cloud with no stable knowledge.  

Before everything, i checked the versions of Git and Ruby through terminal. There is [here](https://medium.com/@IanRahman/how-to-upgrade-ruby-on-a-mac-a592c6085c63) a step by step instruction to upgrade your Ruby.
Now again, i have been through the basics and tried from starting from the very beginning to picking a fancy fancy theme by ending up failures. In one moment i stopped lookiing at every instructions and decided to clear out using/manipulating codes by understanding them. For that, [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com) is my favorite till now. in free version, it is simply giving a practice board to learn HTML, and step by step you find your self in deep oceans with Brown Bears. Below you may see what i mean;

i will be going through this, i finished only 26% of the lectures in CodeAcademy. And by the end of the Academy, i wish to built my own way from scratch.  __.__ 

Meanwhile, PopAcademy is a time limited issue so to be quick (which is already week 4), i decided to set up my site by forking [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) (as 28.4k people in the world.)  

  
  
# right to FORK  
Right to fork refers to have the right to modify your own copy of a software project and maintaining it seperately from the original.
![righttofork]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/posts/2020-6-6-Hello-World/forkL.jpg)  This is usually a prefered form for modification, that you set it on top your own desire, and even help the main source to thrive with implementations.
