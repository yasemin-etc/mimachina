Welcome to championsworld, where many kind of makers are picked from 8 pilot cities and collected in front of a digital blackboard, for an academy about practicing, learning and generating collaboartive makers' space for the circular economy in real. We don't have full access on experimenting in the lab and digital fabrication;since we are in this period of pandemy, but each thursday lectures presented by professionals in many topics related to makers' world and circular economy.  

There in the academy, they provoke our imagination and what we can do for the sake of ourselves, our peripher and/or for all planet. Therefore we have some assignments to practice many things as much as possible.   

Well as a [first assignment](https://hackmd.io/@fablabbcn/SyLUuOS38#Weekly-Assignment---Building-a-Personal-Website), we are asked to build our site in Github, in order to document our experience in the academy. i have met Github years ago and i would say coincidentally i built a site then, but did leave it there in the cloud with no stable knowledge. Now again, i have been through the basics and tried several ways with loads of failures but i have a much clear idea on using/manipulating codes.[CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com) is my favorite till now. in free version, it is simply giving a practice board to learn HTML, and step by step you find your self building an information site about Brown Bears. :)

i will be going through this, i finished only 26% of the lectures in CodeAcademy.Meanwhile, PopAcademy is a time limited issue so to be quick (which is already week 4), i decided to set up my site by forking [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) (as 28.4k people in the world.)
